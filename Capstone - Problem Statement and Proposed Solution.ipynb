House hunters want to live somewhere that matches their lifestyle and personal needs. They also want somewhere that is safe and importantly, within their price range. \n \n Embarking on a search to buy a house can be a frustrating task. \n \n Australian real estate websites often let you enter a maximum of 5 suburbs to search at any one time, and focus mainly on filtering for price and physical features such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. As for choosing a location, house hunters and property managers often do this based on familiarity with a certain area or by what kind of things (good or bad) they may have heard about a place. Very rarely do buyers have access to a central repository of neighbourhood characteristics as well as historical pricing data and the time and effort it would take for them to research all of this is even more rarely an option. \n \n### In a world full of data, why are buyers still left to their own devices when it comes to choosing where to spend their lives?", "attachments": {}}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In order to assist prospective buyers to find the right place to call home, a map will be designed to provide information on each neighbourhood such as popular venues, current housing prices and recent crime rates. \n\nFoursquare venue data will be utilised to determine the most popular venues of each suburb. A classification algorithm will then be used to group neighbourhoods based on their top venues, thereby creating a profile such as \u2018Caf\u00e9 Haven\u2019, \u2018Child Friendly\u2019 or \u2018Nightlife Neighbourhood\u2019 which can be displayed as markers on a map. Users can read short descriptions about each profile and selectively filter neighbourhoods on the map based on their lifestyle preferences. \n\nMedian housing prices and pricing growth rates of Perth will also be displayed on the map so that users can get a general idea of whether a particular area is in their price range, as well use this as a filter if they wish to further narrow down their search based on price. \n\nLastly, Western Australian Crime statistics will be used to determine local crime rates which will be displayed on the map next to the state average crime rate so that users can compare the general safety levels between neighbourhoods. \n\n\nThe proposed data sources are:\n - Foursquare Venue Data \u2013 restricted to neighbourhoods in Perth, Western Australia\n - WA Market: Perth Suburbs Price Data provided from REIWA\n - Western Australian Police Force Crime Statistics \n", "attachments": {}}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
